Title: 0x1C. C - Makefiles
Project on Makefiles
Makefile: File that defines tasks to be executed by issuing commands to recompile.
It can also be put as a set of rules that determine which parts of a program need to be recompiled.
take for instance, a project with 1000 files. Recompiling every file instance every time an update
is made is tiresome and time consuming but with a well defined makefile then the task is well 
automated on recompiling files with the actual updates.
